# Kickstarter-Analysis

## Purpose
An analysis of the Kickstarter data was done to help a client determine the timeframe needed to fundraise for her play. After she did not meet her fundraising goal an additional analysis was performed. The analysis revealed the number of successful, failed and canceled plays and their fundraisers based on their launch dates and monetary goals.

The data was filtered down to only theater plays then differentiated based on the outcome of the fundraiser.

The data was again filtered down to only plays, the new data was then displayed based on the size of the goal and what percentage of plays at those goal ranges were successful, failed or canceled.

## Results

# What are two conclusions you an draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

1. The graph indicates the best months to launch a theater fundraiser are May and June.
2. There are almost no canceled theater projects, likely they are can still opperate on a less than ideal budget.

# What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The graph indicates projects with goals that are very low - less than $5000 - and those with a goal between $35,000 and $45,000.

# What are some limitations on this dataset?
The upper limit of the fundraising goal is cut off at $50,000 which creates a gray area above this threshhold.

# What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1. We could create a graph that shows the effectiveness of fundraisers in each parent category based on their launch date.
2. There could be a use for a graph that displays the average goal based on parent category, which could explain why certain categories have higher rates of success.
