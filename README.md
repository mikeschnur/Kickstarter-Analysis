# Kickstarter-Analysis

## Purpose
An analysis of the Kickstarter data was done to help a client determine the timeframe needed to fundraise for her play. After she did not meet her fundraising goal an additional analysis was performed. The analysis revealed the number of successful, failed and canceled plays and their fundraisers based on their launch dates and monetary goals.

The data was filtered down to only theater plays then differentiated based on the outcome of the fundraiser.

The data was again filtered down to only plays, the new data was then displayed based on the size of the goal and what percentage of plays at those goal ranges were successful, failed or canceled.
